# Search and record data

To fetch data from the Client API during development, a valid Rosetta API URL
needs to be added to `.env` (`ROSETTA_API_URL`). This will allow your container
to fetch the external data required to render explorer result and details
pages.

TODO: Extend this page to include the following:

- Link to Client API documentation
- Who is responsible for the API
- How to interact with the API locally
- Brief overview of each view/url (linking out to code where possible)
